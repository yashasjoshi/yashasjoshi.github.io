								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:170%">Implementation Of An Enhanced Wilkinson’s Power Divider Using Low Pass Filter</h2>
								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:110%">Filters are used to get the harmonics suppressed</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; ">A novel design of power divider using pi-filter is proposed in this paper which suppresses the harmonics in the circuit. There are 
								<br/>several advantages of using this design. The simplicity of the circuit is enhanced as the open circuited shunt stubs are used
								<br/>in Pi-filter. 3 GHz is the frequency that is used throughout the process as the operating frequency. The target of 
								<br/>this implementation is to get an equal power division through the proposed power divider. On simulating the 
								<br/>proposed design on AWR Microwave office suite, it was observed that the harmonics were suppressed 
								<br/>above 3 GHz. The substrate that is used here for the implementation have the following 
								<br/>specifications: Loss tangent = 0, thickness of the substrate = 1.6 mm, 
								<br/>dielectric constant = 2.2 and metal thickness = 0.05 mm.

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:170%">Implementing Access Control in the network for<br/>EIGRP-OSPF And OSPF-RIP Redistribution</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%;">A network containing several nodes, routers, servers and switches, all with specific configurations, is simulated for sole purpose of 
								<br/>realizing a system having several networks using different protocols to communicate with the other networks in the system. 
								<br/>Generally the routing protocols follows different algorithms which can be incompatible with different routing 
								<br/>protocols. The selection of shortest path as well as the exchange of information between the routing 
								<br/>protocols is a critical task in any network having several routing protocols. The simulation 
								<br/>was proceeded using Cisco Packet Tracer software. An access control technique is also 
								<br/>implemented to block or allow few network to communicate few other networks.

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:170%">Design of 80 Gbps Optical Submarine Network</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%;">The modern age, sometimes also referred to as the information age is built upon a vast, globally interconnected communication network. 
								<br/>The core component of this network has been the use of optical fiber networks. An optical fiber network, commonly referred to as an 
								<br/>optical network is a telecommunications network with optical fiber as the primary transmission medium which is designed in such a 
								<br/>way that it makes full use of the unique attributes of optical fibers. Over the last three decades, optical fiber communication has 
								<br/>become the preferred medium for provision of the major infrastructure for voice, video and data transmission, because it 
								<br/>offers far greater bandwidth and is less bulky than copper cables. Due to the rapid growth of the Internet and the World 
								<br/>Wide Web, there was pressing need to develop fast reliable communication between different continents. This challenge 
								<br/>was overcome by optical submarine networks which were essentially optical fibers laid over or under the ocean bed.

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:170%">Acoustic Detection of Rear Approaching Vehicles</h2>
								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:110%">Development of a system which generates an alert for rear approaching<br/>vehicles in case of any probable collision.</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; ">Whenever there is an accident it’s not always your fault sometimes people bump into your vehicles from behind without any warning and in 
								<br/>many cases it turns out to be fatal. So there should be a system that warns you and gives u enough time to react to that situation.
								<br/>Acoustic detection system tells you about the approaching vehicles from rear and warns you so that you can prepare yourself for
								<br/>your next move. For this project around 10-15 samples were taken using a microphone and fed to the MATLAB code which analyses 
								<br/>these samples by using various algorithms according to which, the code determines whether the warning should be given or 
								<br/>not. As the name tells acoustic, this project gyrates around different sounds and its features. For this project all you 
								<br/>need is a microphone and a smartphone which every other person on this planet has. There are several other simillar
								<br/>ways by which this project could have been carried out. Example, video based vehicle detection which includes
								<br/>a camera which is fitted onto your helmet but this turns out to be more expensive than the acoustic 
								<br/>detection. Acoustic detection is a much cheaper way towards safety and provides proper results.
