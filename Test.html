	<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; text-align:justify">Once the product has been made available for the world audience, I should dive right into the analyze phase of the design process.
	</br>In this phase I will gain insight on my newly published product. I attain these insights through product research and user feedback. 
	The analyze phase is quite a pivotal point in the design process.
	<br/></br>I’ve mentioned that it’s important to receive more user feedback and product research to see if my product is truly ready to meld 
	with the end-users. More testing is definitely necessary, it’s all about testing, testing, testing.
	<br/></br>The more feedback I can garner with my end-user audience, the more solid my designs will be for that audience. The more my audience 
	praises my product, the better my product will fare in the market and against my competition.
