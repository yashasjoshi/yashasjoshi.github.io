								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Adapt or Die</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; ">Technologies are constantly evolving and new ones come out and others die almost every day. 
								<br/>I beleive the most important skill a student or a developer should have is the capacity to adapt 
								<br/>fast to this ever changing world. Right now I'm focusing on my college cirriculam and android 
								<br/>development but I know that it could change at any moment depending on the needs that future brings. 
								<br/>I would love to say that I'm a super mega rock-star of coding in C, C++, C#, Html, JS, CSS, Java... 
								<br/>but I ain't. I'm just a student developer that right now enjoys making apps and games for 
								<br/>Android, Windows and Web.

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Design, the right thing</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%;">The wheel is already invented so how can I design a better wheel? 
								<br/>I would approach this task not by making a new wheel but improving and enhancing the wheel that I already have. 
								<br/>Maybe by making a litle lighter, a litle stronger, reusable, cheaper, storable, recyclable, adaptable or even better looking. 
								<br/>A problem could be resolved using designs that are already proven and patterns that other people have tested. 
								<br/>I think a good designer has a good eye to analize and detect an issue and find the right fix.</p>

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Being Agile</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%;">Being "agile" means adopting tools, processes, and a mindset of being nimble 
								<br/>and delivering value as quickly and as often as reasonably possible. Part of this requires accepting a 
								<br/>certain level of uncertainty in planning, as well as performing validation on ideas and concepts ahead 
								<br/>of the decision to execute. It also means saying "no" more often than "yes" and establishing concrete 
								<br/>and specific expectations.
								<br/>Being an agile developer means that I can pick up and adapt to a methodology real quick and seamless 
								<br/>but I think it goes even further. Every team has its own way to do things based on different methods and 
								<br/>practices learn from previous projects. So for me, that means to adapt to the team needs and help accomplish 
								<br/>project goals the fastest way possible.
								<br/>To me, Agile means "doing what works" and constantly reviewing what you're doing to make it better.</p>

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Communicating</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%;">It is no doubt that communication plays a vital role in human life. It not only helps to 
								<br/>facilitate the process of sharing information and knowledge, but also helps people to develop 
								<br/>relationships with others.Right now there are many tools that helps teams to improve their communications.
								<br/>There are cellphone everywhere, whatsapp, facebook, instagram, twitter and what not. Too many applications for the 
								<br/>ease of human beings. Still, I think that communication is even more than having a device or an application capable of 
								<br/>making calls and chats. Communication is an ability to transmit your ideas and needs at the right moment and knowing 
								<br/>that you are a part of the scheme that is functioning to accomplish a specific goal. 
								<br/>Communication is being aware of the fact that you are not an isolated person working on a task that you are a part of.</p>
