								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:200%">A Bit About Me</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:130%;">
									Hey there! I am Yashas Joshi. </p>
									<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%;">
									Currently in my third-year of undergrad at VIT University, Vellore, India,
									I am desperately 
									trying to pursue my B.Tech. degree in Electronics and Communication engineering.
									I am a student having a clear goal in mind. I am always gluttoned by a continuous need to
									transcend my limits in completing any task, i.e. - workaholic environment can make wonders out of me. 
									 Through each of the tasks, 
									not only technical but be it personal or life-related, 
									I tend to extricate at least one priceless constructive
									lesson that I can use for the betterment of my future. 
									 I am a fast learner and as Jim Highsmith says I also believe in the 
									concept that 
									best way 
									to get a project done faster is to start sooner. I usually avoid giving futile justifications for any 
									task undone, I am a bit lazy though. 
									 Substantiating my amiable attitude, people around me tend to be a 
									lot interactive than they often are. I usually spend my recreational time browsing youtube, learning new programming languages,
									creating apps and games for fun, watching TV shows(soapies, thrillers, sitcoms...), movies, playing video games and 
									probably always eating something 
									cause let's face it, <br/>food is our common ground, a universal experience. XD</p>
