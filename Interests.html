									<h3>Music</h3>
									<p style="font-family:Agency FB;text-align:justify">Music is an integral part of my life and I feel very passionate for certain 
									styles such as Hard-Rock, Alt.-Rock... Every now and then you find something that really suits you and I can not explain 
									what it is or how that happens. The thing about Rock music that I feel is the combination of different styles and cultures that 
									makes you think about the posibilities of people getting together and creating something unprecedented.</p>

									<h3>Games</h3>
									<p style="font-family:Agency FB;text-align:justify">The first video game that I ever play was Asteroids in an Atari 2600 that my oldest brother brought home. I remember it was around 9 pm and across the wall I heard a sound that I never heard before it was the ships laser shooting sound I knew that it was something new and cool. The years when by and I ended up studying animation, programming and working on a game development company.</p>
