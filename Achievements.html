								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Adapt or Die</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; text-align:justify">Technologies are constantly evolving and new ones come out and others die almost every day. 
								I beleive the most important skill a student or a developer should have is the capacity to adapt fast to this ever changing world. 
								Right now I'm focusing on my college cirriculam and android development but I know that it could change at any moment depending on the needs that 
								future brings. <br/>I would love to say that I'm a super mega rock-star of coding in C, C++, C#, Html, JS, CSS, Java... but I ain't. 
								I'm just a developer that right now enjoys making apps and games for Android, Windows and Web.

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Design, the right thing</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; text-align:justify">
								 
								The wheel is already invented so how can I design a better wheel? 
								I would approach this task not by making a new wheel but improving and enhancing the wheel that I already have. 
								Maybe by making a litle lighter, a litle stronger, reusable, cheaper, storable, recyclable, adaptable or even better looking. 
								A problem could be resolved using designs that are already proven and patterns that other people have tested. 
								I think a good designer has a good eye to analize and detect an issue and find the right fix.</p>

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Being Agile</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; text-align:justify">Being "agile" means adopting tools, processes, 
								and a mindset of being nimble and delivering value as quickly 
								and as often as reasonably possible. Part of this requires accepting a certain level of uncertainty in planning, 
								as well as performing validation on ideas and concepts ahead of the decision to execute. It also means saying "no" 
								more often than "yes" and establishing concrete and specific expectations.
								Being an agile developer means that I can pick up and adapt to a methodology 
								real quick and seamless 
								but I think it goes even further. Every team has its own way to do things based on different methods and 
								practices learn from previous projects. So for me, that means to adapt to the team needs and help accomplish 
								project goals the fastest way possible.<br/>
								To me, Agile means "doing what works" and constantly reviewing what you're doing to make it better.</p>

								<h2 style="font-family:Goudy Old Style;  font-size:150%">Communicating</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; text-align:justify">It is no doubt that communication plays a vital role in 
								human life. It not only helps to facilitate the process of sharing information and knowledge, but also helps people to develop 
								relationships with others.Right now there are many tools that helps teams to improve their communications.
								There are cellphone everywhere, whatsapp, facebook, instagram, twitter and what not. Too many applications for the 
								ease of human beings. Still, I think that communication is even more than having a device or an application capable of 
								making calls and chats. 
								Communication is an ability to transmit your ideas 
								and needs at the right moment and knowing that you are a part of the scheme that is functioning to accomplish a specific 
								goal. Communication is being aware of the fact that you are not an isolated person working on a task that you are a part 
								of.</p>
