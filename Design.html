	<p style="font-family:Agency FB; font-size:120%; text-align:justify">As designer, I have a clear idea of how I want my product to work and how I would want my audience to interact with my product 
	but usually is not that easy, sometimes I forget to put myself as a user, that's why after going thru the whole schetching procedure 
	a quick prototype is the right way to validate the design.
	</br></br>I found out that getting real feed back from the users is kinda of a challenge and usually they do not share their honest point of 
	view with the design team or the developing team, on this case, myself, many time because they rather to hurt the feelings of thoose 
	working on the project.
	</br></br>When running a test like this it's better to be part of the users taking the test and put atention to the comments they provide and 
	over all and the most important is to put yourself in the user perspective.
